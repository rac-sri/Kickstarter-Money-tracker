### About this project
The project aims at fixing the problem lf the campaign scams that are done on kickstarter.com. Nomrally the campaign leader has complete access to all the fundings and hence can misuse them. This project fixes this using following steps:
1. A person creates a campaign.
2. People can come and contribute to the campaign.
3. The creator can then create requests which will contain details about the way he/she wants to  utilize the money.
4. If >50% contributors agree to the request, the askked money is granted from the collected fund.
